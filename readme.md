# Additional Information

The data API used here is zomato's API. (https://developers.zomato.com/)
The data API by default gives a list of the best restaurants nearby and so the app shows the same by default.
Filtering is provided with the help of an input box. Searching via the input box will show all matches of restuarants in the neighborhood.
Current API limitation is 1000 searches per day.
